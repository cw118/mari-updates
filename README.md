### Step 1: Do your research
Research your program of interest to make an informed decision. Review our entrance requirements for a quick summary of the program prerequisites or consult our frequently asked questions page for any other question. Remember, you can choose a first-choice and a second-choice program. We recommend the following:

For your first-choice program, always choose one with a higher entrance requirement than your second-choice program.
Don't apply to two profiles or concentrations within the same program that have the same entrance requirements.
If applying to Music or a Double DEC with Music, indicate it as your first-choice program because of the audition process.
