Learn more and register for the events.

<strong><u>Applying to Music or a Music Double DEC program</u></strong>

If you have submitted an application to our Music program or one of our Music Double DEC programs (Music-Science, Music-Social Science or Music-ALC), you need to complete a pre-audition as part of the application process. If you have not yet completed one, please contact Hugh Cawker, Music Program Coordinator.

<strong><u>Change of program(s) selected in your online Application</u></strong>

If you would like to change your application program Choice 1 and/or Choice 2, please download and complete the form and have it signed by a parent.

The completed form can be emailed to admissions@marianopolis.edu

Please name your document: 223-xxxx-Last Name, First name

Indicate the student number you received when you submitted your application

The subject line of the email should be: Application: Change of program choice

We recommend the following:

Always indicate as a first-choice program one that requires a higher entrance requirement than your second-choice program
Don't apply to profiles in the same program with the same entrance requirements

For example 200.B1 Health Science and 200.B2 Pure and Applied - these choices have the same entrance requirements


Music and Music Double DECs should always be selected as a first-choice program because of the audition requirements

Please note: Requests will be processed once a week and any new required documents to submit will be posted in Omnivox (for example: letter of intent). The deadline to submit a change is Friday, February 25.

We will not be able to consider any changes to your application program Choice 1 and/or Choice 2 until after April 4. More information to follow.
