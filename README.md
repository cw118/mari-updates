## [Admissions updates](https://www.bemarianopolis.ca/admissions/admissions-updates/)

Checking your Application Status

You can check the status of your application in Omnivox . If your status says "In Progress", it means your file is being evaluated. Decisions will be posted beginning March 11 and into April.

If the status of your application is "AD- Admission-Admitted", you've been accepted, congratulations! Your official acceptance letter will soon be available in Omnivox along with other documents related to your admission. Learn more about how to access your acceptance letter and how to confirm your acceptance online.

If you are admitted to your first-choice program, please note that you will not be evaluated for your second-choice program.

Fall 2022 Admissions Deadline

The deadline to apply for Fall 2022 admission was March 1 at 11:59 pm. Applicants were required to upload any supporting admission documents via Omnivox before this deadline. Please consult our step-by-step guide.

Applications received after the March 1 deadline date will be considered late and will only be evaluated after all applications have been reviewed, if at all, and only if space is still available at the College.

Applying to Music or a Music Double DEC program

If you have submitted an application to our Music program or one of our Music Double DEC programs (Music-Science, Music-Social Science or Music-ALC), you need to complete a pre-audition as part of the application process. If you have not yet completed one, please contact Hugh Cawker, Music Program Coordinator.

Changing the program(s) you selected in your online application

If you would like to change your application program Choice 1 and/or Choice 2, please download and complete this form and have it signed by a parent. The completed form can be emailed to admissions@marianopolis.edu

Please name your document: 223-xxxx-Last Name, First name

Indicate the student number you received when you submitted your application


The subject line of the email should be: Application: Change of program choice

We recommend the following:

Always indicate as a first-choice program one that requires a higher entrance requirement than your second-choice program
Don't apply to profiles in the same program with the same entrance requirements. For example 200.B1 Health Science and 200.B2 Pure and Applied - these choices have the same entrance requirements
Music and Music Double DECs should always be selected as a first-choice program because of the audition requirements

Please note: Requests will be processed once a week and any new required documents to submit will be posted in Omnivox (for example: letter of intent). You will be able to see the change in Omnivox - Consult my File. The deadline to submit a change is February 25. .

We will not be able to consider any changes to your application program Choice 1 and/or Choice 2 until after April 4. More information to follow.

Programs that should be selected as your first choice

If you are considering one of the following programs, we recommend that you select it as your first choice on your application, because of the application requirements, limited enrolment and evaluation of your file.

Music
Music Double DECs
Arts and Sciences
Liberal Arts
Math and Finance
Honours Science

Providing your grades

Most Quebec high schools will transmit grades directly to the central admissions system (SRAM, or Service régional d'admission du Montréal métropolitain). You do not need to send in your grades. The only exceptions are:

If your high school does not transmit to SRAM, you need to upload your Secondary V/Grade 11 mid-term grades. We will obtain your Secondary IV/Grade 10 grades directly from the Ministry of Education.
If you have studied in a Quebec high school only since Secondary V/Grade 11, please upload your Grade 9 and 10 report cards from your previous high schools.
