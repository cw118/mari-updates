Diagnostic and placement tests for Fall 2022 incoming students

Update May 2, 2022

All students who are starting Marianopolis in Fall 2022 will need to take at least one placement test during the month of May. All tests take place online.

Students in the following programs must take the Math Diagnostic Test, 5-6:15 p.m. Tuesday May 3:

Science
Arts and Sciences
Music and Science
ALC and Liberal Arts (only those who selected Math)
Social Science profiles that include Math: 

Math and Finance
Commerce
Two Math

There is no need to study for this test, as it will cover topics you studied in high school. Your results will not affect your admission or be used for placement purposes; they will help us make sure that we make the appropriate adjustments to your Math and Science courses.

Every new student must take the English Placement Test, 5-6 p.m. Tuesday May 10. Your results will not affect your admission; this will help us place you in the correct course stream and identify any support that you may need to succeed as you begin to study at the college level.

Students whose high school grades indicate that they are in two possible levels of French must take the French Placement Test, Monday May 16 to Tuesday May 17. Your results will not affect your admission; they will helps us place you in the French level that is right for you and identify any support that you may need to succeed as you start to study at the college level.

We will notify you and share more details via a Message in Omnivox (MIO).

Evaluation of Admission Files Ongoing

Update April 26, 2022

We have assessed most of our applicant files for all of our programs. We have received questions regarding the RM Verdict Code. This refusal code means that although you have met historical entrance requirements, we have no more space in the requested program.

We will be monitoring our spots over the coming weeks. Should any spots become available in any given program, we will post the information in this section. Currently we are full in most of our programs.

Update April 12, 2022

We are still assessing applications and our programs are filling up. As a gentle reminder, the number of admissions offers we make depends on the quantity of applications, the strength of the applicant pool and the number of spots available in any given program.

We have received more applications for Fall 2022 compared to last year and the year before. The applicant pool in all programs is extremely strong , which means we may not reach our historical averages this year.

We are monitoring our confirmations closely as this will determine if we can offer more spots in our programs in the coming weeks. After the confirmation comparison with other English colleges in mid-April, where students are asked to select one college and release spots at other colleges where they have also confirmed, we hope to be able to make more offers of admission.

Checking your Application Status

You can check the status of your application in Omnivox . If your status says "In Progress", it means your file is being evaluated. Decisions will be posted beginning March 11 and into April.

If the status of your application is "AD- Admission-Admitted", you've been accepted, congratulations! Your official acceptance letter will soon be available in Omnivox along with other documents related to your admission. Learn more about how to access your acceptance letter and how to confirm your acceptance online.

If you are admitted to your first-choice program, please note that you will not be evaluated for your second-choice program.

Fall 2022 Admissions Deadline

The deadline to apply for Fall 2022 admission was March 1 at 11:59 pm. Applicants were required to upload any supporting admission documents via Omnivox before this deadline. Please consult our step-by-step guide.

Applications received after the March 1 deadline date will be considered late and will only be evaluated after all applications have been reviewed, if at all, and only if space is still available at the College. As of April 7, the online application is closed as we are not accepting any new applications.

Applying to Music or a Music Double DEC program

If you have submitted an application to our Music program or one of our Music Double DEC programs (Music-Science, Music-Social Science or Music-ALC), you need to complete a pre-audition as part of the application process. If you have not yet completed one, please contact Hugh Cawker, Music Program Coordinator.

Providing Your Grades

Most Quebec high schools will transmit grades directly to the central admissions system (SRAM, or Service régional d'admission du Montréal métropolitain). You do not need to send in your grades. The only exceptions are:

If your high school does not transmit to SRAM, you need to upload your Secondary V/Grade 11 mid-term grades. We will obtain your Secondary IV/Grade 10 grades directly from the Ministry of Education.
If you have studied in a Quebec high school only since Secondary V/Grade 11, please upload your Grade 9 and 10 report cards from your previous high schools.
