## [Admissions updates](https://www.bemarianopolis.ca/admissions/updates/)

### Fall 2023 Applications
The online application system opened on January 16, 2023. The deadline to apply is March 1, 2023 at 11:59 pm. Students will be able to upload any supporting admissions documents via Omnivox. Please consult our entrance requirements and our step-by-step guide before applying online.

### How does the Charter of the French Language (Bill 96) Impact Fall 2023 Admissions?
The primary impact of the new French Language Charter for Fall 2023 admissions is that it provides slightly different course and exit requirements for students who have a Certificate of Eligibility (CoE) for English-language education.
Certificate of Eligibility
Students who are eligible for English-language primary and secondary education, but who do not have their Certificate of Eligibility (CoE) from the Quebec government should apply for one before June 2023. However, students will not need to submit a copy of their certificate when they apply to the College. Marianopolis will be able to validate each applicant's eligibility directly with their high school or school board.
Admissions Process
For Fall 2023, the application and admissions process remains the same as prior years. Any Secondary 5 / Grade 11 student from any high school, French or English, can apply to Marianopolis. Students will be admitted based on their academic record and any other entrance requirements for their program.
Other colleges and cégeps may take a different approach - this is the approach Marianopolis is taking for Fall 2023: we commit to making an offer of admission to any CoE holder who meets our admission standards.
French Courses
For Fall 2023:

Students with a CoE will continue to take two French courses in order to graduate.
Students without a CoE will now be required to take three French courses in order to graduate.
There are no changes to total course load: students with a CoE and students without a CoE still take the same total number of courses to graduate as prior years.

Language Exit Exam
In order to graduate, students must pass a language exit exam, set and marked by the Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur:

Students with a CoE will continue to write the English Exit Exam.
Students without a CoE will now write the French Exit Exam (Épreuve uniforme de français). These students will take three French courses as mentioned above, which will be designed to prepare them to succeed on the exam.
