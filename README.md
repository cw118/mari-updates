## [Admissions updates](https://www.bemarianopolis.ca/admissions/updates/)

### 1. Do your research
Research your program of interest to make an informed decision. Consult our entrance requirements for a quick summary of the program prerequisites and requirements. Remember, you can choose a first-choice and a second-choice program. We recommend the following: 

For your first-choice program, always choose one with a higher entrance requirement than your second-choice program. 
Don't apply to two profiles or concentrations within the same program that have the same entrance requirements. 
Music and/or Double DECs with Music should always be put as a first-choice program because of the audition process.
